      <h1>Beginner web developer</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Few months ago, i started visiting different websites, watching youtube tutorials and even forums related to web
      development. I even signed in to all kinds of free courses online. Until i found the "NL leert door" program.
      Without a doubt, i told myself that i gonna take this course. The urge to learn web development is what motivates
      me. It is something i wanted to learn but i just never had a chance or time for it. And now, i am a mother of 2
      and have a fulltime job and i realized, if you really want one thing, you will never have any alibis that you
      cannot do it. Despite my busy life, i still manage to learn on my own. Thanks to the opportunity that i got into
      this course in Winc Academy. Hoping for a very positive journey ahead. </p>

      about what i am doing.</p>
