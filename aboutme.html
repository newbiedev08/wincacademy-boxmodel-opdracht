    <p>I am Ivy Kathrina, 37 years old. I am a mother of 2. I have a fulltime job in a warehouse as a Coordinator.Some people say that i am like a robot, that i never get tired. Every single day i wake up early to prepare our day, sending my children to school and then i go to work. After an 8 hour heavy work in a warehouse, i need to fulfill then my duty as a mother. After sending my children to bed, then is it my time to study.It may seems really tiring but i like the way it is, i feel very productive, motivated and positive. I want to learn something new this time. Programming may be tough but i need to prove something to myself. Stay motivated and think positive!</p>
